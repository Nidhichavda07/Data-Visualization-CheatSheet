#  Data Visualization Cheat Sheet Project

A complete data visualization project built using Python and Google Colab.

This project demonstrates 12 different types of charts using a real-world Air Quality dataset (Pakistan - Faisalabad).

The goal of this project is to understand how different visualizations represent data insights and how to use them properly in real-world analytics.

Helps detect correlation between pollutants.

---

## 9️⃣ Box & Whisker Plot

**Purpose:**  
Displays variability and outliers of PM2.5 across days.

**Why It Matters:**  
Identifies extreme pollution spikes and variability.

---

## 🔟 Sunburst Chart

**Purpose:**  
Shows hierarchical breakdown of Season → AQI Category.

**Why It Matters:**  
Explores nested categorical relationships in pollution data.

---

## 1️ Radar Chart

**Purpose:**  
Compares average pollutant levels in one unified chart.

**Why It Matters:**  
Allows multi-metric comparison of pollutants.

---

##  2 Fill-up (Progress Circle) Chart

**Purpose:**  
Displays percentage of "Very Unhealthy" records.

**Why It Matters:**  
Represents pollution severity visually using percentage format.

---

## 3 Heat Map

**Purpose:**  
Displays PM2.5 intensity across days of the week and hours of the day using color gradients.

**Why It Matters:**  
Helps identify peak pollution periods and detect time-based pollution patterns.

**Insight:**  
The visualization shows higher pollution levels during afternoon and evening hours, especially on weekdays.

---

## 4 Pareto Chart

**Purpose:**  
Ranks AQI categories and displays their cumulative contribution using a bar and line combination.

**Why It Matters:**  
Identifies which pollution categories contribute most to overall air quality problems.

**Insight:**  
The majority of records fall under "Unhealthy" and "Very Unhealthy" categories, indicating serious air quality concerns.

---

## 5 Sparkline Chart

**Purpose:**  
A compact time-series chart used to display PM2.5 trends over time.

**Why It Matters:**  
Ideal for dashboards where space is limited but trend visibility is required.

**Insight:**  
Pollution levels fluctuate significantly throughout the day, with noticeable spikes during peak hours.

---

## 6 Speedometer (Gauge) Chart

**Purpose:**  
Displays the current PM2.5 value within a defined range using a dial format.

**Why It Matters:**  
Provides instant visual feedback about pollution severity.

**Insight:**  
Helps quickly determine whether the current air quality is safe, moderate, or hazardous.

---

## 7 Treemap Chart

**Purpose:**  
Visualizes AQI category distribution using proportionally sized rectangles.

**Why It Matters:**  
Makes it easy to compare category dominance visually.

**Insight:**  
Larger blocks represent severe pollution categories, highlighting their impact in the dataset.

---
